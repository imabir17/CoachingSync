-- SQL script to enable RLS and set up multi-tenant policies (High Performance JWT-first version)

-- 1. Create a helper function to get the current user's companyId (JWT-first, fallback to DB)

        SELECT "companyId" INTO cid FROM "User" WHERE id = auth.uid()::text;

-- 2. Create a helper function to verify if the current user is a Super Admin (JWT-first, fallback to DB)

-- 3. Enable Row-Level Security on all tables
ALTER TABLE "Company" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE "User" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
